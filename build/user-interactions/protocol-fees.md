# Protocol Fees

* **Registering a new Record**&#x20;
* **Creating a new License from a record**

At first, these two actions will be free for data provides (only Staking is Required), until a critical mass of assets and applications will incentivize data provider to add a "tip" to validators to include their registrations.

Staking ensures the protocol can penalize Royalty Admins for mis-handeling records or funds, and the immutable nature of the protocol data model allows for tracking the performance of each Data and Payment Provider.

Once a critical mass of assets are being monetized on the network, creating Original Works Records and Licenses will require a payment fee in $OWN token in order to cover the cost of parsing, ingestion and cross reference of records by the network validators.&#x20;

Until this mechanism is activated, staking $OWN will suffice for creation of new Records and Licenses, and the protocol emissions of new tokens will cover the validator costs.\
This ensures a decentralized cross-chain registry that prevents conflicting claims both in the early days of the network.

* **Tokenizing a License** will bare a "tokenization fee" that will be based on the specific network in which the `network fee` + `tip` + `provider fee`
  * the `Network fee` will be determined by the governing committee per each network.
  * the `tip` will be determined by network congestion as a mechanism for faster inclusion.&#x20;
  * the `provider fee` Payment provider may add their fee on top using a this native premetive.
    * Rights holders will pay the Payment Provider the total **tokenization fee** for bringing their cashflows on-chain, while OW will earn 70% of the `network fee`
    * Validators will earn 30% of the network fee + the `tip` component
    * `provider fee` will be pocketed by the Payment Provider.
* **Submitting a Royalty Claim**
* **Submitting a Royalty Payment**
* **Creating a Royalty Pack**
* **Queering the network for a ZKproof about a license statement**
