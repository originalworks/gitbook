### Bridging private record keeping with a public infrastructure

Original works makes use of [standard messaging in the music industry](supporting-industry-standards/) allowing any rights controller or administrator to synchronize their existing infrastructure with a public records database that ensures immutability of records, preserves the privacy of rights holders and ensures uniquely-verified monetization of specifc IP rights in a given territory.

* **Registry:** Protecting copyright and licenses through a decentralized, privacy preserving and immutable database of published musical releases and works and associated rights. Coupled with these public records, each payment provider may synchronize all holdings, claims and payments using Merkle trees (privacy preserving cryptography) providing rights holders with a full audit-trail of royalty payments, without exposing private information of other rights holders.
  * **ISCC and Audio fingerprinting:** As part of the creation of an OW record, the protocol will allow any rights controller to generate a unique [ISCC code](../../learn/ip-identification-and-iscc.md) and audio fingerprint that will allow checking the correlation to existing identifiers such as ISRCs and ISWCs.&#x20;
  * **Preventing conflicting claims:** Ensuring only a single unique licenses can be created per Record (`Asset` & `right type` & `territory`) allows payment providers to clear  I and process royalty payments without worrying about conflicting claims from different payment providers.
  * **On-chain Rights Management:** By tokenizing _ownership_ of a work and/or phonograph - the Original Works Protocol aims to enable the fully decentralized management of governance, including _the_ _exercising of rights._ This will be launched in V3 and backed by the ability of the protocol to govern claims and adjudications on-chain.
  * **Verifiable Credentials**: With Self-custody or via delegated administrators, rights holders are able to submit proofs about privately recorded data, allowing them to monetize their IP or Rights without the friction of gated databases, conflicting datapoints and opaque supply chain rails.&#x20;
  * **Reporting and Royalty Management:** As data providers, publishers distributors and labels use Original Works to privately encode holdings and royalty attribution, which can be verified by each individual rights holder independently without exposing their holdings or earnings. By submitting their DSP reports alongside the deposit of royalties in USDC they can ensure transparent record keeping and including their own split on-chain allows them to provide 100% transparency to their rights holders.
* **Royalty Payments:** As payment providers, publishers distributors and labels or their administrators use Original Works as a settlement layer, cutting off traditional payment providers. Rights holders who decide to tokenize their royalties on Original Works, connect to their Payment Provider's royalty pool and can privately claim all their earnings in a batch process, and may do so to a private address to full obfuscate any correlation between claims processing and earnings.
  * **Splits:** As rights holders can prove their ownership to the protocol simply by connecting their wallet, they are able to assign any splits and update the state of the Merkle tree; Using OW this way, Payment Providers empower their  with self custody to incentivize collaborations, promotions, activate their community or access royalty advances.\

  * **Packs:** In order to interact with other smart contracts (to make royalty advances and/or investments in their IP), rights holders may redirect all payments to an aggregated address, representing a collection of monthly cashflows from multiple licensees.
  * **Claims:** Each rights holder may connect their wallet to the Payment Provider's royalty pool and claim all revenues from all earnings into a single obfuscated transaction directed to any anonymous address that he can prove ownership of. This ensures all individual payments are fully transparent and auditable by rights holders, while private to anyone other than themselves and their elected payment provider. This also ensures the entire royalty pool cannot be tampered with
