# Data Channels

Data channels: Official protocol Royalty Admins are able to provide attestations about registered assets via D`ataChannels`. These may be private or public and provide immutable record of any datapoint or statement about an asset and the public signature of the message signer. Anyone can setup a data channel and message the OWN protocol with information about a registered asset, but only verified `DataProvider` signatures should be considered to be a verified data source, and are legally accountable for the information they provide. The protocol tokenomics incentivize data providers to provide accurate information on time and penalizes underperformance.\
\
Data channels may include conditional chaining logic, historic financial data, fraud clearance, rights registration or any other records.

#### Data Management

The `DataChannel` is owned by a data provider and creates an immutable record trail of statements, updates, off-chain information about any asset in the protocol - obviously statements about the assets registered by the same party should bee more trustworthy, but data channels are designed to be permissionless as they cannot trigger any native protocol action.

At the end of the day, disputes can only be settled in court, but having immutable proof of **who** claimed **what**, **when** and based on **which** datapoints, making a copyright claim or ensuring an asset isn't automatically taken down by content ID networks if it may have a license on chain becomes much more feasible
