# OW Releases

**While a Work or Recording identifier may be registered independently, they are recorded on the Original Works registry only in the context of a Release** (usually identified by a UPC or similar identifie) - this identifier represents the grouping of several works and recordings into a single product that is monetized under a specific deal.&#x20;

When a new `OW_Record` is created, it may include existing ISRCs, ISWCs or ISCCs alsready associated with other releases, but the `rightType`,  `Territory` can only add up to `100% sharePercentage` accross all releases.&#x20;
