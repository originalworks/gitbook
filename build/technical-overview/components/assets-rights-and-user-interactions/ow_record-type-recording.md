# OW\_Record type: Recording

A `DataProvider` registering **`Recordings`** on Original works must include the `Resource` identifier (i.e. ISRC)  as the key value (alongside `Territory` and `rightType)`.  Any `MusicalWork` identifier (i.e. ISWC)  will be treated as metadata, but will not override the `MusicalWork` identifier submitted by the registration of the **`Work`**.\
\
A **Recording** that has not bee registered as an OW\_Record (i.e. it was merely specified as metadata in the registration of an `OW_Record_type:Work`) _cannot_ have any associated **`Deals`**
