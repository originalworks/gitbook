# Validator Clients

Running an independent network of validators is required to achieve the following goals:

* Ensuring the incoming messages have a valid structure before being processed&#x20;
* Structuring the incoming data to be indexed by subgraph
* Ensuring network staking mechanisms filters are decentralized
* Validating ZK Proofs about public record submissions and private license details for permitted queries.&#x20;

Validators also reduce the cost of operations for data providers, and further decentralize the process of data validation. Therefore emissions from the protocol will reward validator participation until a critical mass of royalties are settled on-chain, at which point data providers will include an inclusion fee for validators to include their incoming registrations in their blob storage.

**Becoming a validator** \
In order to participate and earn $OWN for validation of new incoming records, becoming a validator includes staking $OWN & $USDC. Each month 11 validators are chosen from a pool of applicants. The validators are chosen in an auction process, where the 11 validators who commit to the highest stake (stakes are comprised of 50% USDC and 50% $OWN) are chosen. If a validator is found to be fraudulent, they are slashed.
