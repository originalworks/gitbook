# Royalty Payments

{% hint style="info" %}
By design all token balances and royalty payments should be privately available to RightsHolders and exposable p2p on-demand by RightsHolders (or any delegate).
{% endhint %}

### **Royalty payments are designed to optimize for two key goals**

#### **1. Making and payments private and verifiable**

Refer to our Privacy Section to learn more about how we are building privacy-preserving payment rails that are fully provable by rightsHolders in our introduction section [here](../../../../protocol/privacy.md)

**2. Accelerating payments and democratizing access**

Just like we are incentivizing Validators to validate asset and license registrations to ensure disambiguation of records and no conflicting terms can co-exist, we committed to incentivize dataProviders and Relayers to optimize settlement time and automate transfer splits, batch payments, network-bridging, hybrid payments and applicable recoupment or withholdings.

### Currencies

#### Royalties: on-chain stable coins

All royalties will be paid in stable coin to ensure we do not expose rightHolders to unwanted volatility; we currently support USDC and use bridge.xy as an offramp partner.

**Fees: Aligning incentives in the music industry around the artist's best interest**

The $OWN token will be used to pay fees and community grants will allow early adopters to use the protocol for free. Additionally, through the settlement fee mechanism we will reward efficient and the Original Works foundation continuously promote more flexible payouts and faster settlement. Data Providers will be able to provide better payments, unlock liquidity, increase efficiency and ultimately drive more business for themselves and their artists.
