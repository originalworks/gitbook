## Technical Terms

- **Blob Storage**: A data storage mechanism (EIP-4844) that temporarily stores data on-chain at reduced cost compared to permanent storage.

- **ERC1155**: A token standard on Ethereum that allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single smart contract.

- **IPFS**: InterPlanetary File System, a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data.

- **KYC**: Know Your Customer, a verification process that identifies and confirms customer identity to comply with regulatory requirements.

- **KZG Commitment**: A cryptographic commitment scheme used to efficiently prove properties of a polynomial without revealing the polynomial itself.

- **Merkle Tree**: A tree-like data structure where each leaf node contains a hash of a data block, and each non-leaf node contains a hash of its child nodes, enabling efficient verification of large datasets.

- **Stablecoin**: A cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by pegging to a reserve asset like the US dollar.

- **UTXO Model**: Unspent Transaction Output model, a method of tracking ownership in cryptocurrencies by recording unspent transaction outputs. This is considered as an alternative approch to Merkle Trees in particular cases.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof**: A cryptographic method allowing one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information.
