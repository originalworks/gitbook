# Operating an Original Works Royalty Pool

The key benefits of the Original Works Royalty Pools:

* Maintain your existing contracts and splits system
* OWEN automatically records rights to your Royalty Pool - both clients run locally or on your hosted setup
* Complete privacy of commercial relationships
* Full compliance with industry standards
* Cutting out intermediaries and increasing the revenue margin&#x20;

How it Works:

1. Any asset that has been successfully registered via the Original Works validator network can be tokenized, by registering the splits on your own hosted Royalty Pool
   * Royalty Pools use [Merkle Tree storage](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/merkle-trees-in-blockchains). Think of it  like a secure filing cabinet - it always uses the latest version of splits for calculations, but keeps the individual percentages private. The pool generates statements showing each rights holder only their portion of each asset's revenue. the and issuing publi
2. Once the pool recorded the splits, each right holder is issued a voucher that unlocks his current split at any given moment.
3. Rights Holders can then use this voucher to claim royalties, transfer splits, prove income to 3rd parties and verify their splits.
