# Operating an Original Works Royalty Pool

Here's how our privacy-preserving royalty distribution system works;

The key benifits of our deisgn:

* Maintain your existing contracts and splits system
* OWEN automatically records rights to your Royalty Pool
* Complete privacy of commercial relationships
* Full compliance with industry standards
* Cutting out intermediaries and increasing the revenue margin&#x20;

How it Works:

1. Any asset that has been successfully registered via the Original Works validator network can be tokenized, by registering the splits on their own hosted Royalty Pool
   * Think of the Merkle tree like a secure filing cabinet - it always uses the latest version of splits for calculations, but keeps the individual percentages private. The pool generates statements showing each rights holder only their portion of each asset's revenue. the and issuing publi
2. Once the pool recorded the splits, each right holder is issued a voucher that unlocks his current split at any given moment.
3. Rights Holders can then use this voucher to claim royalties, transfer splits, proove income and verify their splits.

When you receive consumption reports from DSPs, instead of calculating individual payments, you simply deposit the total revenue into your Royalty Pool and assign amounts per asset. The pool then automatically calculates each rights holder's share based on the pre-registered splits stored in its Merkle tree.

Rights holders can then submit claims for multiple statements at once. When they do, the system automatically generates a new receiving address tied to their existing account. This means each withdrawal goes to a fresh address, making it impossible to track payment patterns.

Most importantly, each claim comes with a cryptographic proof that verifies they received the correct percentage of each asset's revenue. This proof confirms their payment is accurate without revealing anything about other rights holders or the total pool amount. It's like getting a redacted bank statement where you can only see your own transactions but can mathematically verify they're correct.

So while you maintain control of royalty deposits and compliance checks, rights holders get privacy and verifiable accuracy for their earnings. The entire process remains compliant since all claims must pass KYC/AML checks before approval.
