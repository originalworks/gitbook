# Protocol Overview

> This section of the Original Works documentation is currently in design stages and outlines the product specifications for a blockchain-based protocol, designed to manage music intellectual property (IP) rights and royalty payments. The protocol aims to enhance transparency, efficiency, and trust and liquidity in the music industry by leveraging decentralized ledger technology and verifiable credentials.

### 7. Protocol Personas

#### BusinessMusicalWorkContributorRole

* **CopyrightClaimant**: A party listed as copyright owner at the time of registration.
* **CopyrightHolder**: A party to whom copyright has been granted or transferred.
* **MusicPublisher**: A party that enters into contracts and/or assignments with composers, promoting usage, licensing, collecting royalties, and developing partnerships.
* **OriginalPublisher**: A rights controller assigned rights directly by the writer.
* **SubPublisher**: A party acquiring rights from a music publisher for a specific territory and period.
* **SubstitutedPublisher**: A party acting on behalf of a music publisher or rights controller.
* **Unknown**: Used when the value within the allowed value set is unknown.
* **UserDefined**: Defined by the sender of a DDEX message in a manner acceptable to its recipient.

#### RightsControllerRole

* **RightsController**: A party controlling rights in one or more creations for specific territories, time periods, rights types, usage types, and commercial models.
* **RightsAdministrator**: A party administering rights on behalf of one or more rights controllers.
* **RoyaltyAdministrator**: A party collecting and distributing royalties on behalf of one or more rights controllers.
* **Unknown**: Used when the value within the allowed value set is unknown.
* **AdministratingRecordCompany**: A record company responsible for administering rights in a resource or release without ownership or control of rights exploitation.
* **LocalPayee**: A company paid for the scope of rights defined in accompanying rights statements.
* **RightsHolder**: A party holding rights in one or more creations for specific territories, time periods, rights types, usage types, and commercial models.

#### ContributorRole

* **CopyrightHolder**: A party to whom copyright has been granted or transferred.
* **RightsControllerType**:
  * **OriginalOwner**
  * **SuccessorInTitle**
  * **ExclusiveLicensee**
* **RightsCoverage**:
  * **MakeAvailableRight**: The right to make a work available to the public.
  * **MechanicalRight**: The right to record and distribute a work on a carrier.
  * **PerformingRight**: The right to perform a work.
  * **PrintRight**: The right to make a visual copy of a work and distribute it.
  * **ReproductionRight**: The right to make a physical reproduction of a work.
  * **SynchronizationRight**: The right to include a work in timed relation with other works for making an audiovisual or multimedia creation.
  * **UserDefined**: Defined by the sender of a DDEX message in a manner acceptable to its recipient.

### 8. Building Trust with Verifiable Credentials

#### Authenticated Distribution and On-Chain Provenance

* **Blockchain Technology**: Using blockchain to create an immutable ledger that records the issuance and transfer of verifiable credentials. This ensures that the ownership and rights of musical works are transparent and verifiable.
* **On-Chain Provenance**: Tracking the history of a musical work from its creation to its distribution, ensuring that all transactions and transfers are recorded and can be audited.

#### AI Rights Management and Smart Contracts

* **Audio Content Recognition**: Utilizing wavelet technology for precise audio content recognition, ensuring accurate identification and protection of intellectual property.
* **Smart Contracts**: Automated rights recognition and enforcement using blockchain technology. Smart contracts can automatically execute transactions based on predefined conditions, ensuring that rights holders are compensated fairly and promptly.

#### Monetization Optimization and Infringing Use Detection

* **Recommendation Engine**: Analyzing contract data and streaming metrics to identify unmonetized usage and optimize earnings for rights holders.
* **Infringing Use Detection**: Automatically detecting and addressing unauthorized uses of music, safeguarding the rights and earnings of legitimate artists and rights holders.

### 9. Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Design and Prototyping**
   * Define detailed technical specifications.
   * Develop a prototype of the blockchain network and smart contracts.
2. **Phase 2: Testing and Validation**
   * Conduct extensive testing to identify and resolve issues.
   * Validate the protocol with real-world use cases.
3. **Phase 3: Deployment**
   * Deploy the protocol on a public or private blockchain network.
   * Onboard initial participants and start recording transactions.
4. **Phase 4: Scaling and Optimization**
   * Optimize the protocol for performance and scalability.
   * Expand to include more participants and use cases.

### 10. Benefits of Verifiable Credentials for the Music Industry

#### For Artists and Rights Holders

* **Protection of Rights**: Ensuring that only authorized individuals and entities can claim and manage music rights.
* **Optimized Earnings**: Identifying unmonetized usage and optimizing revenue streams through accurate rights management.

#### For Industry Stakeholders

* **Trust and Transparency**: Building a trustworthy and transparent ecosystem where the ownership and rights of musical works are verifiable and secure.
* **Efficient Rights Management**: Streamlining the process of rights management and enforcement, reducing administrative burdens and costs.

### 11. Case Study: Addressing the Negative Impact of Fake Streams

#### The Problem with Fake Streams

* **Artificial Boosting**: Using fake streams to create an illusion of popularity, leading to distorted market perceptions and unfair advantages.
* **Algorithmic Penalties**: Low engagement rates from fake streams can ruin an artist's algorithmic profile, reducing their chances of being recommended to real audiences and harming their long-term marketing ROI.

#### How Verifiable Credentials Can Help

* **Authentic Engagement**: Ensuring that only genuine streams are counted, improving the accuracy of engagement metrics and algorithmic recommendations.
* **Transparency and Accountability**: Providing a transparent record of streaming activities, making it easier to detect and address fraudulent behavior.

### 12. Security Considerations

* **Cryptographic Security**: Use of strong cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions and credentials.
* **Data Privacy**: Ensuring sensitive information is protected and only accessible to authorized parties.
* **Consensus Mechanism**: Implementing a robust consensus mechanism to maintain the integrity of the blockchain.

### 13. Future Developments

#### Upcoming Features

* **Enhanced Fraud Detection**: Developing more advanced algorithms for detecting and preventing rights violations and fraudulent activities.
* **Integration with Digital Platforms**: Expanding our partnerships with streaming services and other digital platforms to ensure comprehensive rights protection.

#### White Paper on Verifiable Credentials

* **In-Depth Analysis**: A detailed exploration of how verifiable credentials can transform the music industry, providing insights and recommendations for industry stakeholders.
* **Case Studies**: Real-world examples of how verifiable credentials have been successfully implemented to address rights management challenges.
