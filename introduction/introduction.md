## Introduction


Original Works is a decentralized protocol designed to enhance and streamline the music industry's rights management and royalty distribution system. By leveraging blockchain technology, zero-knowledge proofs, and innovative privacy-preserving mechanisms, the protocol enables efficient synchronization of global music IP records while creating new opportunities for rights holders to manage and monetize their assets.

The protocol's foundational principle is evolution, not revolution. Original Works does not aim to replace the existing music industry supply chain or require artists and fans to change how they engage with music. Instead, it provides a secure and efficient layer for existing industry participants to streamline their operations, reduce costs, and offer enhanced services to rights holders. By building upon established industry practices and infrastructure, the protocol enables traditional music industry service providers to leverage blockchain technology while maintaining their essential role in the ecosystem.
