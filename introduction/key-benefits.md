The Original Works protocol delivers immediate, practical benefits to all participants in the music ecosystem:

## For Rights Holders:

- Privacy-Preserving Claims: Rights holders need only present their ERC1155 voucher tokens to claim royalties, while their ownership percentages and earnings remain completely hidden from the blockchain. By generating new claiming addresses for each transaction, the protocol ensures that payment patterns cannot be tracked or analyzed by external observers.
- Stable Value Distribution: Royalties are distributed in stable coins, protecting rights holders from cryptocurrency volatility while enabling automated, trustless distribution through smart contracts. This combines the efficiency of blockchain technology with the stability of traditional currency, ensuring predictable income streams.
- Capital Efficiency: Verified on-chain rights can be used as collateral for DeFi services

## For Music Service Providers:

- Reduced Operating Costs: Automated reconciliation and settlement reduce administrative overhead
- Enhanced Services: Providers can offer new financial products backed by verified rights data
- Business Continuity: Integration requires minimal changes to existing operations

## For the Industry:

- Global Accessibility: Standardized protocol enables participation from any jurisdiction
- Market Efficiency: Transparent, verifiable rights data creates liquid markets for music assets
- Innovation Platform: Open protocol enables new services built on verified rights data
