# About Original Works

### What is Original Works?

Original works is a Web3 protocol for music IP royalties that enables the entire music industry to build new products, advance financial freedom for artists, and enhance the fan engagement experience.

Original Works provides the web3 music stack for creators to monetize their music IP, music businesses to bridge royalty payments on-chain, and developers to build high performance applications. Original Works is fully compatible with your favorite web3 tools and services.

Our vision with Original Works is to bring greater transparency, liquidity and price discovery to the music IP market. Democratizing access to music IP begins by transforming it into a digital asset, connecting traditional royalty pipes to on-chain protocols and DeFi projects..

### Why use Original Works?

Creators lack tools to monetize IP, access liquidity and build their own (platform-agnostic) community. The vast majority of earning catalogs are not accessible to web3 markets and protocols that could leverage the value of the underlying IP.

Rights Managers and Label teams lack the tools to manage, track and account for all of their (web2) digital assets and Web3 financial transactions across different blockchain networks from one place.

We are building the web3 infrastructure to reshape digital IP ownership and radically transform the way creators get paid for their work, by putting the power of royalties back in the hands of artists.

### What Are the Guiding Principals Leading to Our Design Choices?

Most music assets today are off-chain, under-monetized and illiquid. Providing a privacy preserving, decentralized and immutable records of rights, licenses unlocks the ability to tokenize the off-chain royalty payments, solution to creating a liquid, efficient, and transparent market that everyone can access.

Founded by music industry veterans, pioneering in digital reporting of music IP monetization and digital supply chain management throughout the digital transformation of the industry in the past two decades we are building the protocol under the following assumptions, which are being validated with our design partners throughout the development phase of the protocol:

1. Rights holders, artists, creators and most independent labels rely on service providers administrating and monetizing and protecting their rights.
2. Service providers will need to continue protecting the privacy of their customers and need a simple  non-disruptive solution to securely sync their data
3. Service providers would enjoy the benefit of monetizing their data if they can have an easy plug-and-play solution to provide Verifiable Credentials about assets, rights, licenses, payments and claims.
4. All rights holders will be happy to validate the accuracy of their revenue by a non-trusted 3rd party, while retaining full privacy on their data.&#x20;
5. All Rrights holders will enjoy the benefit of easily migrating their catalog and/or licenses
6. Most rights holders would enjoy access to fair and transparent liquidity in the form of royalty advances and loans for IP catalog investments
7. DeFi pools can tap into new RWA tokenized markets with new and emerging legal frameworks
8. Most artists and creators will benefit from direct-to-fan monetization as long as it is easily integrated into their commercial setup



### Who can participate?

The Original Works protocol offers new technical, legal, and economic frameworks that enables creators, rights owners, and service providers to collectively engage in rights management and royalty distribution without a centralized infrastructure, while still relying on valuable service providers.

Our aim is to create a vibrant ecosystem of the worldâ€™s creative IP supply chain, bringing together in one community creators, rights holders, music businesses, builders, developers, fans and buyers of creative and music-related IP to enable a sustainable ecosystem.
