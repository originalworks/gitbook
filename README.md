# About Original Works

### What is Original Works?

Original works is a web3 protocol for music IP royalties that enables the entire music industry to build new products, advance financial freedom for artists, and enhance the fan engagement experience.

Original Works provides the web3 music stack for creators to monetize their music IP, music businesses to bridge royalty payments on-chain, and developers to build high performance applications. Original Works is fully compatible with your favorite web3 tools and services.

Our vision with Original Works is to bring greater transparency, liquidity and price discovery to the music IP market. Democratizing access to music IP begins by transforming it into a digital asset, connecting traditional royalty pipes to on-chain protocols and DeFi projects.

### Why use Original Works?

Creators lack tools to monetize IP, access liquidity and build their own (platform-agnostic) community. The vast majority of earning catalogs are not accessible to web3 markets and protocols that could leverage the value of the underlying IP.

Rights Managers and Label teams lack the tools to manage, track and account for all of their (web2) digital assets and Web3 financial transactions across different blockchain networks from one place.

We are building the web3 infrastructure to reshape digital IP ownership and radically transform the way creators get paid for their work, by putting the power of royalties back in the hands of artists.

### How does the Original Works Protocol work?

Music assets are off-chain under-monetized and illiquid. Tokenizing music IP is the key solution to creating a liquid, efficient, and transparent market that everyone can access.

1. Music IP rights holders bridge their traditional music royalty payments by creating a Original Work Royalty Asset (RA)&#x20;
2. The RA and cash flows are verified, facilitated and transferred via their distribution partners, who act as Verified Payment Providers (VPP )&#x20;
3. With an RA, artists and rights holders access a new world of financial and fan engagement products for music royalties.

### Who can participate?

The Original Works protocol offers new technical, legal, and economic frameworks that enables creators, rights owners, and service providers to collectively engage in rights management and royalty distribution without a centralized infrastructure, while still relying on valuable service providers.&#x20;

Our aim is to create a vibrant ecosystem of the worldâ€™s creative IP supply chain, bringing together in one community creators, rights holders, music businesses, builders, developers, fans and buyers of creative and music-related IP to enable a sustainable ecosystem.
