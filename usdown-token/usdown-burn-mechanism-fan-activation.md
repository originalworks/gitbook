# $OWN burn mechanism: fan activation

### Community Building and Fan Tokens

Music is inherently a social experience, deeply intertwined with both personal and collective aspects of human life. Just as we believe that artists and creators should retain as much control over their IP and how it is monetized, we believe artists should be able to set the terms and reward their most loyal fans with unique experiences or products based on different activation sequences. Web3 allows artists to shape their own experiences and reward fans directly for their engagement or loyalty.

Through our extensive network of IP partners we are rewarding $OWN tokens to artists and labels, registering their assets on Original Works. As $OWN tokens will be required to later tokenize these assets, early adopters will earn tokens rather than pay for minting. Through our individual partnerships, we are ensuring a wide and diverse distribution of $OWN tokens. \


#### Burning $OWN tokens: distributing rewards back to the community:

As the early adopters, namely artists and labels, will earn more $OWN then they will need in the long term, $OWN tokens will be redeemable in exchange for Fan tokens, which can be issued directly by the artist or label holding $OWN through our onboarding partnership. These Fan promotional tokens can unlock unique experiences and be distributed to as many tiers or groups defined by the partner platform, allowing super fans to accumulate specific artist tokens and compete for clout, access and exclusivity.\

The reward mechanism for each platform partnership will be announced with the publication of our seasonal program of releases through our extensive network of creator platforms, IP network partners, artists, labels, distributors, creative collectives, and communities. The full program will be available and updated on the original.works website.
