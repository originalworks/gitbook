# Why is OWEN crucial to enable Royalty Tokenization

The OWEN client and validator network create a crucial trust layer for music rights tokenization. Here's why both steps are essential:

OWEN processes industry-standard release notifications (DDEX/CWR) that establish:

* Verifiable source (licensed distributor/publisher)
* Official identifiers (ISRC/ISWC)
* Rights ownership details
* Release metadata

Independent validators then:

* Verify the source is an authorized Oracle
* Confirm data integrity
* Check for duplicate registrations
* Index verified assets

This two-step verification prevents:

* Unauthorized token minting
* Duplicate asset registration
* Fake rights claims
* Counterfeit releases

Without this process, anyone could create tokens claiming to represent famous songs, making the system vulnerable to fraud. The combination of authorized Oracles (music industry participants) and independent validators ensures only legitimate rights can be tokenized.
