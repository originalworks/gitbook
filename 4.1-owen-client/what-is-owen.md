# What is OWEN?

OWEN (Original Works Electronic Notification client) is a client software that processes standard music industry messages (DDEX.ERN and CWR) for blockchain registration. It performs these key functions:


1. Message Processing
   1. Parses XML formats
   2. Validates data structure
   3. Stores complete data on IPFS
2. Blockchain Integration
   1. Submits data via blob storage
   2. Manages transaction costs
   3. Handles error recovery
   4. Maintains audit logs

OWEN requires minimal infrastructure ($50/month hosting) and accepts industry-standard formats, allowing music companies to participate in the protocol without changing their existing workflows.

For further referrence on how OWEN interacts with the Original Works protocol and the broader music supply chain take a look at the [Original Wroks Flow](https://docs.original.works/original-works/1.-introduction/user-flow)
