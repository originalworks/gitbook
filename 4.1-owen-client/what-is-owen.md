# What is OWEN?

OWEN (Original Works Electronic Notification) is a client software that processes standard music industry messages (DDEX.ERN and CWR) for blockchain registration. It performs these key functions:\


1. Message Processing
   1. Parses XML formats
   2. Validates data structure
   3. Generates zero-knowledge proofs
   4. Stores complete data on IPFS
2. Blockchain Integration
   1. Submits data via blob storage
   2. Manages transaction costs
   3. Handles error recovery
   4. Maintains audit logs

OWEN requires minimal infrastructure ($50/month hosting) and accepts industry-standard formats, allowing music companies to participate in the protocol without changing their existing workflows.
