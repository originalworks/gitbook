# History

The Original Works protocol is developed and maintained by Revelator, a leading provider of digital IP infrastructure to music companies around the world.

Revelator was founded in 2012 with the mission to bring speed, accuracy and transparency to music rights management, digital supply chain and royalty distribution. We’ve established ourselves as a best-in-class music IP SaaS platform, serving over 175 music distributors, record labels and management companies representing 250,000 artists around the world.&#x20;

Revelator began work on the Original Works protocol in 2018. Our team unites music industry experts and blockchain developers, leveraging our deep understanding of rights and royalty workflows with the goal of bridging music IP on chain, and connecting traditional royalty pipes to web3 protocols and DeFi projects.&#x20;

Over the last several years, we conducted pilots with leading rights organizations and music publishers to validate and extend the protocol's capabilities to both performance and mechanical royalties.

In 2019, in an industry-first partnership, Revelator, BMAT and Teosto demonstrated a new standard for paying songwriters and music publishers within 24 hours rather than two years for radio broadcast performance royalties.&#x20;

In 2020, Revelator worked with a major label publisher on accelerating the reporting of mechanical royalties from 100 to 30 days, providing on-chain pipeline visibility to all the writers and partners directly to a digital wallet.

In 2021, we were awarded a $1.3M research and development grant from the Israeli Innovation Authority to further Revelator’s work on the Original Works protocol, the first fully functional creator rights and revenue management platform on the blockchain.&#x20;

The grant supported Revelator’s ongoing innovation in decentralized financial services for artists and creators. Revelator developed a smart contracts based micro-financing protocol  to bridge the funding gap between the time a song streams online and the contract pays out. This allows creators to collect royalties faster directly into their wallets in seconds, fund new projects and achieve a whole new level of independence.

Our latest DeFi lending products will be the next step in building a robust back-end system to run music revenues on the blockchain, with all its royalties, rights, and value.

Revelator also independently interacts with the protocol in two ways, as a core developer and as a Royalty Admin facilitating on-ramping music IP and royalties on chain.

We’re expanding the ways blockchain can forge a new path in an industry that has long struggled with slow and inaccurate payments and complex administrative systems. Many startups have attempted what we have actually achieved: bringing decentralized financial tools to artists and creators worldwide.
