# Web3 Applications

The Revelator team is accelerating the adoption of the Original Works protocol with a suite of web3 applications designed to on-ramp creators and rights holders without any knowledge of crypto or coding.&#x20;

### Revelator Wallet

The Revelator wallet is a non-custodial digital wallet allowing artists to collect royalties and get paid daily in stable coins and access the benefits of DeFi, NFTs and Web3.

The Revelator Wallet is the first and only multi-chain wallet for music and media assets built around the creator experience and designed for the creator economy.

Artists can request an advance based on their share of the assets’ pipeline revenue on a daily basis. The protocol collateralizes the royalties and automates repayment from monthly royalty settlements.

Artists can also mint, drop, sell NFTs across marketplaces directly from the Wallet and easily create NFT storefronts to power web3 digital commerce for fans and collectors without any code or development.
