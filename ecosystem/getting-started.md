# Getting Started

### The Original Works Ecosystem

Original Works is a protocol for music IP offering a full suite of web3 applications for artists, distributors, record labels, publishers, platforms and brands designed to on-ramp creators and rights holders without any knowledge of crypto or coding.

By design, Original Works is an open platform enabling anyone to record IP rights and ownership information, manage custody of their creative works, exchange value directly with others without intermediaries or middleman, and dramatically increase the speed at which business gets done.

By leveraging distributed ledger technology and smart contract applications, Original Works aims to create the most trusted digital business network for creative assets by providing the necessary infrastructure, protocols and applications using a shared, standard and extensible data format.

The protocol enables creators and IP rights owners from around the world to securely register their works and copyright,  issue blockchain-based tokens for a creative work representing fractional ownership, or income rights in the underlying work, broker instant contracts, license rights and content, access capital, receive royalties as they generated, and paid directly to their digital wallet with near real-time visibility to all participants involved in the chain of rights.

Original Works asset-backed lending protocol unlocks a universe of open financial applications for creative professionals, provides working capital and access to immediate cash flow by bridging the funding gap between when content is licensed or distributed to global streaming platforms, and when those contracts and royalties pay out.

Our aim is to create a vibrant ecosystem of the worldâ€™s creative IP supply chain, bringing together in one community creators, managers, rights holders and buyers of creative and music-related IP and enable a sustainable ecosystem.
