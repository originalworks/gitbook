## Merkle Tree Implementation

Original Works implements a comprehensive privacy system that protects sensitive business information while maintaining verifiability of rights and payments.
Merkle Tree Implementation

### The protocol uses sequential Merkle trees to store rights splits and payment data.

**Each leaf contains a hash of:**

- Rights holder identifier
- Share percentage
- Asset identifier
- Payment history

Updates to splits create new tree states while maintaining historical records, enabling both current operations and historical verification.

```
Tree Structure:
Root = Hash(Left || Right)
│
├── Rights Data
│   ├── Rights holder ID (hashed)
│   ├── Share percentage (encrypted)
│   └── Access controls (hashed)
│
└── Payment Data
    ├── Amount (encrypted)
    ├── Timestamp
    └── Transaction proof
```
**Security Measures:**
- Salted hashing for leaf values
- Double-hashing for IDs
- Encrypted percentage values
- Versioned tree updates
- Collision resistance
- Independent verification paths
