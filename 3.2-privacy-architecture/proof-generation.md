### Proof Generation
The system generates zero-knowledge proofs for:
- Rights ownership verification
- Payment amount validation
- Historical earnings confirmation
- Split percentage validation

All proofs maintain privacy while enabling verification of:
- Correct payment amounts
- Valid ownership claims
- Accurate revenue shares
- Historical records

### Example: Verifying Revenue Share

```
Rights Holder wallet application requests proof of 15% share in Asset A:

1. Input:
   - Asset ID: 0x123...
   - Claimed Share: 15%
   - Period: Q1 2024

2. Proof Generation:
   - π = Generate_ZK_Proof(
       asset_id: 0x123,
       holder_id: 0x456,
       share: 15%,
       merkle_path: [hash1, hash2, hash3],
       root: root_hash
     )

3. Verification:
   - Verify(π) confirms share without revealing:
     * Total splits
     * Other holders
     * Absolute amounts
```
