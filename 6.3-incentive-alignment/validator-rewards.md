### Validator Rewards

Validators receive carefully balanced incentives to maintain network security and integrity:

- **Economic Rewards**:
  - Validation fees for processing submissions
  - Staking rewards proportional to contribution
  - Performance bonuses for reliable operation
  - Special rewards for detecting invalid submissions

- **Reward Scaling**:
  - Higher rewards for processing complex submissions
  - Volume-based reward tiers
  - Reliability multipliers
  - Longevity bonuses

- **Risk-Balanced Returns**:
  - Stake-weighted distribution
  - Slashing protection for honest mistakes
  - Transparent reward calculation

- **Non-Financial Incentives**:
  - Protocol governance participation
  - Network influence proportional to contribution
  - Recognition for network support
  - Access to expanded services cross-chain data availability and proof validations

The validator reward system ensures sufficient economic incentive to maintain network security while preventing excessive concentration of validation power.
