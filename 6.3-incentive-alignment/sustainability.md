  - Scalable architecture for growing demand
  - Upgrade paths for technical evolution
  - Backward compatibility commitments
  - Research and development funding

- **Governance Evolution**:
  - Progressive decentralization roadmap towards a permissionless ecosystem
  - Stakeholder representation mechanisms
  - Transparent parameter adjustment through voting machanisms
  - Dispute resolution frameworks

- **Market Resilience**:
  - Counter-cyclical incentive structures
