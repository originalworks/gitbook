# Tokenomics

## Purpose of $OWN Token

$OWN Token will be a ERC20 token designed to serve two main functions within The Protocol:

1. **Staking for Data Providers**

   - To submit new BLOBs containing DDEX messages Data Providers must stake a required amount of $OWN Tokens into the `StakeVault`.
   - This ensures that only serious participants can contribute data to the protocol.

2. **Rewarding Validators**
   - Validators receive $OWN Token as a reward for validating BLOBs using their computing power.
   - This incentivizes accurate and efficient validation of DDEX messages.

## Why Staking is Required?

Staking acts as a security measure to maintain the integrity of The Protocol:

- If a **Data Provider submits an invalid BLOB**, part of their **stake will be slashed** as a penalty.
- This discourages malicious actors from spamming the queue with invalid or fraudulent data.

The staking and slashing mechanism ensures that the network remains efficient and free from unnecessary congestion.
