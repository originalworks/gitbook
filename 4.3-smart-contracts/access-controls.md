# Access Controls

## Overview

Our smart contracts implement a **whitelisting feature**, which can be toggled based on the network environment.

## Testnet Access (Open Participation)

During the testnet phase, we have **disabled whitelisting**, allowing **anyone** to participate without restrictions. This ensures broad access for testing, feedback, and community engagement.

## Mainnet Access (Whitelisted Participation)

Once we transition to mainnet, we will temporarily **enable whitelisting** so we can restrict participation to **approved accounts only**, only until a decentralized access control is developed.
