# Privacy

### Design Principle: Verifiable Private data

1. Hide balances
   1. `RightsHolder` of tokenized Assets ( **`Creation or License)`**
   2. Ownership of License&#x20;
   3. Obfuscate payments between assets and rights holders
2. Obfuscate payments
3. Allow Data Providers to store immutible private records about asset
4. Allow rightsholders to easily and securely access these proofs.

#### Definition

* **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**: Digital statements made by an issuer about a subject, which can be cryptographically verified.

#### Integration

* **Issuance**: Trusted entities (e.g., PROs, labels) issue VCs to artists and rights holders.
* **Verification**: Participants can verify VCs to ensure the authenticity of claims.
* **Storage**: VCs are stored securely on the blockchain or in decentralized storage solutions.

#### Use Cases

1. **Artist Identity Verification**: Ensuring the legitimacy of an artist or rights holder.
2. **Ownership Claims**: Verifying claims of ownership and rights.
3. **Licensing Agreements**: Authenticating licensing terms and agreements.





























#### Monetization Optimization and Infringing Use Detection

* **Recommendation Engine**: Analyzing contract data and streaming metrics to identify unmonetized usage and optimize earnings for rights holders.
* **Infringing Use Detection**: Automatically detecting and addressing unauthorized uses of music, safeguarding the rights and earnings of legitimate artists and rights holders.

### Verifiable Credentials:

### Benefits of Verifiable Credentials for the Music Industry

#### For Industry Stakeholders

* **Trust and Transparency**: Building a trustworthy and transparent ecosystem where the ownership and rights of musical works are verifiable and secure.
* **Efficient Rights Management**: Streamlining the process of rights management and enforcement, reducing administrative burdens and costs.

### Case Study: Addressing the Negative Impact of Fake Streams

#### The Problem with Fake Streams

* **Artificial Boosting**: Using fake streams to create an illusion of popularity, leading to distorted market perceptions and unfair advantages.
* **Algorithmic Penalties**: Low engagement rates from fake streams can ruin an artist's algorithmic profile, reducing their chances of being recommended to real audiences and harming their long-term marketing ROI.

#### How Verifiable Credentials Can Help

* **Authentic Engagement**: Ensuring that only genuine streams are counted, improving the accuracy of engagement metrics and algorithmic recommendations.
* **Transparency and Accountability**: Providing a transparent record of streaming activities, making it easier to detect and address fraudulent behavior.
