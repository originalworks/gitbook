# Privacy

### Guiding principles

Registration and payment solutions on Original Works are built upon the basic blockchain constructs of decentralization, immutability and self-custody. While we strongly believe in the importance of transparency, we also understand how important it is, **if we want to offer&#x20;**_**true**_**&#x20;self-custody**, to allow artists and other holders of rights to protect their own privacy and elect what information they wish to make public. We do not believe an "open protocol" as we intend Original Works to be should force rights holders to give up all privacy for better financing solutions.

Transparency however has always been a sensitive issue in the music industry as it is used mainly by managers and other representatives of `RightsHolders` to maximize their leverage and earnings in negotiations.

`RightsHolders` don't want to expose how much they are earning, what deals their managers have obtained for them, and how much of their catalog they actually own. `DataProviders` such as distributors and royalty societies have no interest in exposing this sensitive data and therefore there is no efficient, easy and accessible way today to extract or purchase specific datapoint about a specific asset by 3rd parties.

Now, leveraging the amazing developments in [Zero Knowledge proofs](https://chain.link/education/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp), coupled with the scalability of [Layer 2s](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-are-ethereum-layer-2-blockchains-and-how-do-they-work) and [Account Abstraction](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/), we can make the right amount of information available without compromising Rightsholders' privacy.

**Making Rights Holdings and Payments Private and Verifiable**

The main challenge is keeping the EVM composability, while strengthening privacy, minimally degrading the user experience and ensuring there are no compromises in security.

Original Works will:

* allow `RightsHolders` to validate their ownership without revealing other holders' balances
* allow `RightsHolders` to obfuscate payment via batch payments to their private wallets
* allow `RightsHolders` to prove how much they got paid from a license by sharing a secret with 3rd parties
* allow `DataProviders` to check there is no `RightsRegistered` (duplicate record in the Registry) governing the same `rights` for the same `Creation` in the same `region`
* allow `PaymentProviders` to check there is no duplicate record of a license monetizing the same `RightsRegistered`

In order to design a long-lasting interoperable solution, this challenge will require an industry-wide initiative of research, development and experimentation with existing, affordable and battle-tested solutions out there. As a decentralized protocol, we encourage integrating other open-source solutions and steering the community to find the most applicable solution for each challenge.\

At Original Works we are already developing several solutions as seen on the [protocol roadmap](https://github.com/originalworks/protocol/milestones), and invite anybody interested to join our repo and engage with us directly about taking part in the R\&D and documentation efforts.

We will announce our grant program in Q4 2024 and some of the most exciting opportunities lie in the intersection of privacy and UX.
