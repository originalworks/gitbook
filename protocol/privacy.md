# Privacy

### Design Principle: Verifiable Private data

1. Hide balances and ?_identity?_
   1. `RightsHolder` of tokenized Assets ( **`Creation or License)`**
   2. Ownership of License&#x20;
   3. Obfuscate payments between assets and rights holders
2. Obfuscate payments
3. Allow Data Providers to store immutible private records about asset
4. Allow rightsholders to easily and securely access these proofs.

#### Definition

* **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**: Digital statements made by an issuer about a subject, which can be cryptographically verified.

#### Integration

* **Issuance**: Trusted entities (e.g., PROs, labels) issue VCs to artists and rights holders.
* **Verification**: Participants can verify VCs to ensure the authenticity of claims.
* **Storage**: VCs are stored securely on the blockchain or in decentralized storage solutions.

#### Use Cases

1. **Artist Identity Verification**: Ensuring the legitimacy of an artist or rights holder.
2. **Ownership Claims**: Verifying claims of ownership and rights.
3. **Licensing Agreements**: Authenticating licensing terms and agreements.
