# How the OWN protocol works

Artists and other music IP rights holders elect to bridge their music royalty payments to the OWN protocol by creating an Royalty Assets token. The Royalty Assets token represents their agreement to receive future royalty payments to an assigned on-chain wallet from revenue generated by digital streams, physical sales of records, merchandise or NFTs. The Royalty Assets token smart contract can be used to access other apps and dApps enabled by the OWN protocol, such as receiving advances on future royalties.

Each Royalty Assets tokenmust be validated and signed by an OWN protocol Oracle. Oracles are participants in the music industry who have the access, visibility and ability to ensure that royalty payments move on chain to the Royalty Assets token (for example distributors and record labels). In return for validating Royalty Assets tokens and providing the tools for artists to create Royalty Assets token, Oracles receive service fees from the protocol.

To ensure proper functioning of the protocol additional parties exist: Data Providers (‘DP’), Fraud governance and the OWN Foundation. Data Providers provide additional data and analysis on Royalty Assets tokens so that protocol participants can better assess the risks and profiles of Royalty Assets token. Fraud governance acts to ensure that OWN contracts are valid, payments flow properly on chain. The OWN Foundation is the governing body of the protocol, made up of representation from the different participants in the protocol: artists, rights holders, digital streaming providers (DSP), distributors, record labels, public rights organizations (PRO) and developers.
