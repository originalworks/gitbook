# Overview

The OWN protocol facilitates a new era of streamlined financial and fan engagement options for artists and rights holders.&#x20;

* **Financial offerings** such as daily royalty payments, micro lending and advances on future royalties, splitting and trading of royalty payments.&#x20;
* **Fan engagement** options include linking artist communities and NFTs to revenue streams, enabling new options for fan and community building, and new revenue streams from asset sales such as music NFTs.

By linking traditional music IP payments such as digital streams, physical sales and merchandise to web3 primitives, the OWN protocol enables the creation of a transparent marketplace of music related IP with a range of benefits, such as cutting down the two to six months most artists wait to get paid, democratizing access to financial products not previously available to artists and fans which enable more access for communities to support their artists.&#x20;

The OWN Protocol is built in collaboration with the music industry, with the goal of improving transparency and financial freedom for artists and rights holders.&#x20;

The OWN protocol is composed of:

1. **Artists and rights holders** who elect to tokenize their music royalties into an OWN Media Asset (OMA).
2. **Music rights distributors, management platforms, labels and publishers** who act as protocol oracles, validating the IP rights and sending royalty payment streams to OMAs.
3. **Liquidity providers** who contribute liquidity for artist payments in real time against future royalty streams.&#x20;
4. **Data providers** who provide access to proprietary analytics, financial risk modeling and additional data to assess OMAs.&#x20;
5. **Fraud governance** acts to ensure that OWN contracts are valid and payments occur on time on chain.&#x20;
6. **Governance** to enable modifications and future improvements to the protocol as industry dynamics change.&#x20;
