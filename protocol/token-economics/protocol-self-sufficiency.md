# Protocol self sufficiency

### Why $OWN token?

The OWN protocol serves different stakeholders and use cases, all with different goals. For these stakeholders to cooperate and work effectively together toward the common goal of democratizing access to music IP and for the protocol to have longevity, we introduce the $OWN token to incentivize and align interests.

$OWN serves as the utility token of the protocol enabling different use cases of the protocol for all stakeholders. As protocol usage grows, the value of the network increases and the utility of stakeholders' $OWN increases.

The OWN protocol aims to become the financial layer for creative assets, serving artists, creators,  rights holders and distributors alike. To ensure the longevity of the protocol, a portion of the fees paid to use protocol components revert to the protocol and some are distributed to network participants as rewards for their participation. These include fees from creating OMAs, sending royalty payments, opening a wrapped OMA and submitting fraud claims.

### What percentage does the protocol take for usage?

Protocol fees are low and can be impacted by protocol governance. At launch fees will be:

* 1% protocol fee for payment transfers (split between the validating oracle and the protocol)
* $25 USD per OMA creation (paid in $OWN)

### Who gains from the protocol fee?

Protocol fees will be recycled into the OWN protocol reserve and community allocation. All participants in the OWN protocol gain rewards from the protocol fee. As users and contributors to the network every participant in the network who stakes $OWN will receive a pro rata share of the protocol distribution. This includes artists who create OMAs, oracles, liquidity providers etc.

The reuse of spent tokens for new protocol initiatives and community engagement will serve to strengthen the longevity of the protocol.
