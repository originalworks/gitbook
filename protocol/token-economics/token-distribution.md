# Token Distribution

### Genesis

$OWN will be distributed at genesis to network participants required to operate the protocol including oracles, liquidity providers, initial artists who create OMAs and developers. Following the launch, $OWN tokens will be distributed at a declining rate to participants in the network who contribute the most to the success of the network: oracles who lock up capital to secure the protocol from fraudulent OMAs, artists and rights holders who participate, developers and liquidity providers.

An initial supply of 100,000,000 $OWN will be minted, with an ongoing issuance rate of 2% commencing after five years, subject to governance. The purpose of this issuance curve is to favorably incentivize early adopters while maintaining incentives for the long term growth and usage of the OWN protocol.

The initial supply will be distributed according to contribution to the network and with the goal of seeing an equal distribution of ownership in the OWN protocol among the relevant network participants.
