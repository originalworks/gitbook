# Royalty Payments

{% hint style="info" %}
By design all token balances and royalty payments should be privately available to RightsHolders and exposable p2p on-demand by RightsHolders (or any delegate).
{% endhint %}

### Guiding principles

Payment Solutions on Original Works build upon all existing blockchain constructs, leveraging the amazing developments of L2s, account abstractino and zk proofs, and are centered around spcifically optimizing two key features for the creative eoconmy

**Making Paytments Private and Verifiable**&#x20;

The main challenge is keeping the EVM composability, while strengthening privacy, doing so securely and minimally degrading the user experience

In order to design a long-lasting interoperable solution, this challenge will require an industry-wide initiative of research, development and experimentation with battle-tested solution to find the most applicable solution for each chalange. \
\
At Original Works we are already developing several solutions to be deployed in the coming months, and invite anybody interested to join our repo and engage with us directly about taking part in the R\&D  and documentation efforts.

We will announce our grant program in Q4 2024 and some of the most exciting opportunities lie in the intersection of privacy and UX.&#x20;

**Accelerating payments and democratizing access**

Just like we are incentivizing Validators to validate asset and license registrations to ensure disambiguation of records and no conflicting terms can co-exist, we committed to incentivize dataProviders and Relayers to optimize settlement time and automate transfer splits, batch payments, network-bridging, hybrid payments and applicable recoupment or withholdings.&#x20;

### Currencies

#### Royalties: on-chain stable coins&#x20;

All royalties will be paid in stable coin to ensure we do not expose rightHolders to unwanted volatility; we currently support USDC and use bridge.xy as an offramp partner.

**Fees: Aligning incentives in the music industry around the artist's best interest**

The $OWN token will be used to pay fees and community grants will allow early adoptors to use the protocol for free. Additionally, through the settlement fee mechanism we will reward efficient and the Original Works foundation continuously promote more flexible payouts and faster settlement. Data Providers will be able to provide better payments, unlock liquidity, increase efficiency and ultimately drive more business for themselves and their artists.
