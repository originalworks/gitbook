# Private "on chain" payments

The concept of private on-chain payments allows all payment flows to be pre-assigned to their rightful recipient 0x addresses (by matching tokenized licenses and rights holders with the registered asset reporting income) while allowing each individual to privately prove their ownership and claim their aggregate share of royalties on-demand to a private wallet address. &#x20;



A Public 0x address will hold a single token per `license` - a `Royalty Token` **without** revealing how much of the rights in that license he/she owns. Each rights-holder can aggregate multiple `Royalty Tokens` (one per each license they own a portion of the rights to) in their wallet, proving ownership and gaining access to some underlying private data.&#x20;

Each Rights holder owning a `Royalty Token` in their wallet address will be able to connect their wallet (Public 0x address) in order to:

* reveal their own percentage of their individual license tokens (i.e. percentage of revenue they are intitled to, and how their revenue share is calculated) without revealing other rights holders individual shares.
* generate a proof of ownership percentage on demand (to share with defi contract, 3rd parties, etc..)
* claim any royalties from the protocol royalties pool
* reveal private metadata available only to rights holders
* receive their payment in private: i.e. provide a private 0x address as the recipient address of all claims related to this public 0x address.&#x20;
