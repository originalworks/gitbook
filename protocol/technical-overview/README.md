# Technical Overview

### Design Principals

#### Open Source

#### Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Storage

* **Decentralization**: The protocol uses a combination of distributed storage and public blockchain infrastructure to ensure data is stored in a decentralized and verifiable manner, eliminating single points of failure and disincentivizing fraud.
* **Immutability**: Once recorded, data cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity of rights and ownership records.
* **Accessibility:** The permissionless infrastructure allows for anyone to register assets and licenses - Protocol users will immediately know if they are interacting with a verified music supply chain service provider (a verified `DataProvider)` indicating that they need to verify and trust the issuing account.
* **Balancing Privacy and Transparency**: Using several developments in cryptography and adoption by public blockchains, it is now feasible and economical to provide full turnkey solution for programmable-royalties on-chain with full privacy and immutability. Several solutions can be adopted to solve different problems&#x20;
* **Permissionless and verifiable:** verified `DataProviders` vare vetted service providers and protocol/token stakeholders, and unverified `DataProviders`can effectively launch on-chain distribution, simply by having trusted counterparties authenticate their keys.

#### Minimum disruption to individual Data Provider's workflows and existing data models

* **Data Chanels:**&#x20;
* **Ddex adoption:**
* **ERC standard Opcodes:**

#### Smart Contracts

* **Automation**: Smart contracts automate the execution of agreements, such as royalty payments, based on predefined conditions.
* **Enforcement**: Smart contracts enforce the terms of agreements without the need for intermediaries.

#### Tokenization

* **Self Custody (Digital Assets)**: Royalties[^1] and/or IP rights are tokenized, allowing them to be traded and managed on the blockchain.
* **Fractional Ownership**: Tokenization enables fractional _ownership of IP_ **or** _right to collect revenue_, allowing multiple parties to hold stakes in a single asset.
* **RWA:** We consider the underlying assets and cashflows tokenized by the Original Works Protocol to be Real World Assets in the sense that the

#### Zero Knowledge Proofs and Network Validators

* **Verifiable Credentials**: Using Original Works, rights holders (or their administrators) can submit verifiable credentials that a certain fact about an asset, entity, license or payment is true or not, without knowing the any other fact about the data itself. This provides two fundamental advantages: (i) **Rights Holders** can leverage their IP while protecting their privacy without relying on intermediaries, and (ii) **Service Providers** can monetize their data without any additional effort, while continuing to safeguard the rights and privacy of their customers
* **Cross-chain permissionless record keeping**: As generating verifiable proofs about privately stored data is computationally intensive andNetwork validators ensure tha

In This section we will cover the basic building blocks of the protocol (**`Creations`** and **`Licenses`**), which represent the the "real-world asset" and related "cashflos" respectively, and how they relate to the different Personas and User Roles.
