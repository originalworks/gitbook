# Royalty Licenses

Royalty License - A Smart Contract directing payments based on conditional contract logic to apply splits - These are different from RTs as they are not based on Token distribution, but rather a JSON file representing the business terms and payment logic of the binding agreement; It has a list of payees, contractual terms and conditions, and is governed by the issuing IP Smart Contract.

* Normally the Royalty Asset 0x addresses, governed by the same IP Asset will be a party to this License, but not necessarily.
* Royalty License payments are executed using the OW native Revenue Splits mechanism.
* Licenses can address license specific terms like payment to agents, 3rd parties, tax withholding, reimbursement, payable advances or any other business logic.
