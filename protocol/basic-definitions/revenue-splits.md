# Revenue Splits

Revenue Splits: An RA can distribute any incoming payment among different wallets. Payments can be split based on the distribution of the contractâ€™s individual tokens at any given time, or based on conditional logic submitted by a verified Payment Provider and calculated independently using Chainlink functions to ensure full decentralization.
