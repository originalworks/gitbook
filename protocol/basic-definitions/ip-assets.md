# IP Assets

IP Assets are smart contracts that allow rights holder to verify and tokenize their lawful ownership of a published work or media asset. As owners of the underlying IP, the token-holders of a specific IP Asset contract can collectively control any associated rights they wish to grant, to whom and under what condition - providing an asset-level governance mechanism.

Each IP Asset is minted as an independent smart contract with individual tokens and assigned initial- holders, representing their underlying ownership %. Tokens are used as they can easily and securely be transferred/sold, allow to delegation governance and allow each individual to determine how they want to control their own intellectual property rights.

* IP Assets can be minted on any chain, and the Original Works Network secures the IP registration is synced across all networks.
* IP Assets can be categorized in any format (ISRC, ISWC, NFT, ISCC, etc..)
* Having a verified Data Provider verify the authenticity of the registration grants the IP Asset a "blue check" indicating and official&#x20;
* By tokenizing IP ownership the Original Works Protocol grants IP owners full control over
