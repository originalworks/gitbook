### Protocol participants and their different user roles

#### Accessible to anyone but built for music industry professionals, labels and web 3 builders

As a permissionless protocol, it is accessible to any artist who wants to have full control and self-custody on their supply chain, but as an industry solution, it is designed and aimed at the broader spectrum of the music industry supply chain managers, such as rights managers, royalty administrators, distributors, royalty societies, record labels, and the likes, all representing the interest of common rights holders, artists and creators.

#### Who are the users Protocol End Users?

Original Works is an infrastructure layer intending businesses and applications to build custom workflows on top of our royalties infrastructure and decentralized (privacy-persetcing) asset registry.

Once IP and it's cashflows is tokenized music IP becomes a liquid digital asset any interested party, smart contract, application or person can use the permissionless protocol or registry app to look up public information about musical works, releases or related licenses. Alternatively, they can requesting access to or /acquire private data directly from the protocol - bypassing the administrative costs, while still compensating the admins and service providers. Users can therefore interact directly with the rights-holders or smart contracts, while data providers that populated this data can continue to passively monetise it. \

In this section we will explore the different personas of the protocl, which can each assume several user roles.
