# Data Providers

`DataProviders` are businesses in charge of any part of the music supply chain, and provide services to `RightsHolders`. As such, they are the permitted "Persona" to create new records in the Original Works Registry, and provide factual information about the assets they administer. As a sort of oracle to the network, `DataProviders` compete on Original Works to provide on metrics like cost, data integration, Integrations with payment providers, access to liquidity, ease of governance and delegation, etc..&#x20;

\
Data Providers can be any of the following :&#x20;

* Digital Streaming Platform (DSP)&#x20;
* Record Labels&#x20;
* Distributors
* Copyright Societies
* Performing Rights Organizations
* Collective Management Organizations
* Participating financial Institutions & Lenders
* DeFi Protocols

> Traditionally "Oracles" provide protocols with off-chain data, but in those cases they are unbiased 3rd parties to the protocol; Therefore the term `DataProviders` seems more appropriate to describe music supply-chain admins and rights controllers, as they will require to maintain a stake of $OWN tokens and protocol validators will validate their incoming transactions.

Music royalty revenue is not a traditional form of cash flow; each asset has multiple payment sources and terms, that are represented by different service providers in different jurisdictions, and therefore there is no straightforward way to accurately price license to collect royalties from a given asset in a specific jurisdiction; If the license and underlying terms are not made public - and they never are - it can be very hard to estimate or predict its future earnings and forecast future flows.\
\
Original Works solves this issue in two features available to Data Providers

1. Allowing these existing service providers to publicly record the assets and rights they manage in a given territory, and the share percentage of their administrative control, while keeping all the underlying data about the licenses, rights holders or revenue completely private.
2. Licenses to receive any royalty income can be tokenize, while private sensitive information can remain off-chain. ZK proofs can be easily produced by Data Providers (at each of the rights holders' request). These proofs can validate one's earnings match his respective share without revealing others, and can be exposed to DeFi contracts with specific details about earnings or other private contract terms.

This ensures the full transparency and provenance about the Data Provider's managed assets and existing rights holders. It can then be securely and privately shared in the market by any rights holder or manage. Enabling access to the underlying cashflows on chain will create numerous new business opportunities for these traditional music service providers, and offer better rights and financial for their customers. &#x20;
