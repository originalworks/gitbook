# OWN Media Asset (OMA)

An OWN Media Asset is the smart contract governing an on-chain music IP asset and is the core building block of the OWN protocol. It represents an assured payments stream on-chain that is tied to a real world music IP asset income such as digital streams, merchandise (physical, digital or digital collectibles such as NFTs) or physical music sales. By way of its validation and backing by oracle, an OMA links an “off-chain” payment stream into an on-chain payment stream.

An OMA has several attributes:&#x20;

* Oracle signature validation of authenticity&#x20;
* Asset fact sheet including:&#x20;
  * Trailing months revenue
  * Artist details&#x20;
* Splits of revenue: an OMA can divide payment between different wallets
* Currency of on chain payment (USDC, LUSD, ETH, OWN, etc)&#x20;
* Copyright infringement red flags in case of off chain legal issues with the royalty stream&#x20;
* Service fee: Protocol fee which is split between the protocol & oracle&#x20;
* Burn mechanism: in the event the artist wants to remove the OMA from the blockchain

Artists will be able to control how much financial information they share on chain, for example limiting the number of trailing months revenue that is shared in the asset fact sheet. However, less on chain transparency will limit the market for their OMA. In the future, Zero Knowledge proofs will enable greater flexibility with artist privacy.

An OMA is the core building block of the OWN protocol and the door to a new financial asset class of media related IP. OMAs can be used by artists to gain liquidity on their future income streams through liquidity pools, OTC markets or other DeFi protocols and NFT markets. Owning an OMA grants artists, labels and other rights holders financial freedom and control over their IP income stream.
