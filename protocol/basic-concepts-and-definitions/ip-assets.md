# IP Assets

IP Assets are smart contracts that allow rights holder to verify and tokenize their lawful ownership of a published work or media asset. As owners of the underlying IP, the token-holders of a specific IP Asset contract can collectively control any associated rights they wish to grant, and under what conditions - providing an asset-level governance mechanism.

Each IP Asset is minted as an independent smart contract with individual tokens and assigned initial- holders, representing their underlying ownership %. \
Tokens are used as they can easily allow each individual to determine how they want to control their own intellectual property rights. Tokens can securely be transferred/sold, allowing delegation or transfer of governance rights.

* IP Assets can be minted on any chain, and [**Original Works Validators**](original-works-validators.md) ensure that the IP registration is synced and no duplicates can be submitted, across all networks.
* IP Assets can be categorized in any format (ISRC, ISWC, NFT, ISCC, etc..)
* Having a verified Data Provider verify the authenticity of the registration grants the IP Asset a "blue check" indicating a verified rights organization&#x20;
*   By tokenizing IP ownership the Original Works Protocol grants IP owners full control over

    2. Securing the registration of their rights on decentralized/permissionless and privacy preserving **Registry** referencing any publishing or distribution file standard they already use.
    3. The creation of **Royalty Licenses**&#x20;
    4. Minting of a **Royalty Asset** (only one can exist at any given time)
