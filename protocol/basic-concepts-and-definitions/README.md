# Basic Definitions

**Governance vs. Collection Rights: The IP Asset and the Royalty Assets**

At the heart of the OWN protocol is the OWN Royalty Asset (RA). This smart contract manages and secures the flow of royalties generated from rights to monetize IP and is tied to both on-chain and off-chain (“real-world”) media revenue streams, like digital streams, physical sales or merchandise. Thanks to validation from a verified Payment Provider, the **RA** bridges off-chain payment streams with on-chain ones.\
\
The **Royalty Asset is the** first building block we are enabling in order to enable on-chain payments and self custody or royalties, but as such - today the Royalty Asset, is minted and governed by any **Verified Payment Provider** (VPP) which commits to make royalty payments on chain, making the flow of funds dependent on intermediaries. \
\
This provides an immutable record of rights and payment, automated splits, and enables advances and micropayments. As the protocol grows and the In order to make a **Royalty Asset** governed by its actual rights holders we will introduce the **IP Asset** that will allow for the lawful rights holders of any IP to administer and govern any related **Royalty Asset**, giving the **VPP** authority to tokenize and make on-chain payments as well.\
