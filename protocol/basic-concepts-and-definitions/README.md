# Basic Concepts and Definitions

**Governance vs. Collection Rights: The IP Asset and the Royalty Assets**

At the heart of the OWN protocol is the OWN Royalty Asset (RA). This smart contract manages and secures the flow of royalties generated from rights to monetize IP and is tied to both on-chain and off-chain (“real-world”) media revenue streams, like digital streams, physical sales or merchandise. Thanks to validation from a verified Payment Provider, the **RA** bridges off-chain payment streams with on-chain ones.\
\
The **Royalty Asset is the** first building block we are enabling in order to enable on-chain payments and self custody or royalties, but as such - today the Royalty Asset, is minted and governed by any **Verified Payment Provider** (VPP) which commits to make royalty payments on chain, making the flow of funds dependent on intermediaries. \
\
This provides an immutable record of rights and payment, automated splits, and enables advances and micropayments. As the protocol grows and in order to make a **Royalty Asset** governed by its actual rights holders we will introduce the **IP Asset** that will allow for the lawful rights holders of any IP to administer and govern any related **Royalty Asset**, giving the **VPP** authority to tokenize and make on-chain payments as well.\
\
As Royalty Assets represent the default split of revenue, **Royalty Licenses** are smart contracts used to rights a particular usage of the rights granted by the IP Asset contract. They have a fixed terms and conditional payment logic and like **Royalty Assets**, they are a tokenized a revenue source, unlike Royalty Assets, they do not have tokens, but rather a fixed list of payees. \
