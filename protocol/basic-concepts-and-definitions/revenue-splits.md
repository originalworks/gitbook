# Revenue Splits

Any [**Royalty asset**](royalty-assets-and-royalty-tokens.md) or [**Royalty License**](royalty-licenses.md) can distribute any incoming payment among different wallets. \
\
With Royalty Assets, this is based on a list of token holders that may change hands, while with Royalty Licenses, the contract will list a fixed list of beneficiaries. While these two contracts may be chained - \
\
All revenue paid by verified [**Payment Providers** ](verified-payment-provider.md)will first be fulfilled by any business logic governed by the license and only then send any "un-categorized" payments to the [**Royalty Asset** ](royalty-assets-and-royalty-tokens.md)0x address of the same [**IP Asset**](ip-assets.md) that is being monetized.&#x20;
