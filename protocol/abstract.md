# Abstract

Music royalties are a $45 billion industry suffering from slow and opaque IP rights management and payments. Artists and rights holders often must wait two to six months to get paid from the day their music was streamed and rely completely on the intermediaries throughout the music industryâ€™s value chain.&#x20;

The challenge in managing and providing artists control and transparency over these payment flows has prevented musical assets from providing artists with the utility and financial freedom of other income-bearing assets.&#x20;

We introduce the Original Works Network (OWN) - A protocol to to enhance transparency, efficiency, and trust in the music industry by leveraging decentralized ledger technology and verifiable credentials, bringing liquidity to music royalty payments and democratizing access to music IP.

**The OWN protocol enables artists and rights holders to validate payment accuracy, receive advances on future revenue and directly monetize their music IP.**&#x20;

By collaborating with the music industry to bring music royalties to web3, the OWN protocol powers a fast global settlement layer, powering an ecosystem of financial offerings and applications built on top of music and IP assets.&#x20;

**OWN is the only web3 music project focused on working with the traditional music industry and conforms to all existing data models and messaging syntax.** \
\
Parts of the OWN protocol and application layer have been put into practice already, including the asset management via smart contracts to enable artist royalty splits, a micro lending application for artist advances, and the Revelator wallet, a first of its kind artist-focused web3 wallet.
