### Definition and Requirements

In the Original Works protocol, Royalty Admins serve as bridges between off-chain music industry data and the blockchain network. While initially these entities will be established music service providers who already manage rights administration and royalty collection, the protocol is designed to evolve into a completely permissionless public good. Once the token economy stabilizes, staking $OWN will become the sole requirement for Royalty Admin status, ensuring the protocol remains truly decentralized and accessible to all qualified participants.

To qualify as an Royalty Admin, an entity must:
- Be a legally registered business entity in their jurisdiction (This requirement will remain in affect only during the first phase of the protocol, before being completely replaced by staking, transforming OW to a permissionless protocol)
- Have existing contractual relationships with rights holders 
- Stake a minimum amount of protocol tokens as security 
- Demonstrate technical capability to run the OWEN client 
- Generate standard industry formats (DDEX.ERN, CWR) 
- For tokenization purposes, Royalty Admins also commit to maintaining accurate and timely royalty accounting records and must add $OWN to their total stake in order to enable royalty payouts from the Royalty Pool
