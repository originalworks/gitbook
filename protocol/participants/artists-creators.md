# Artists/Creators

Artists are the creators of IP and OWN Media Assets.&#x20;

This includes:

* Writers
* Composers
* Performers
* Content Creators
* Designers

Artists elect to bridge their off chain royalty stream to web3 and tokenize this income stream to access the broader network of services that the OWN protocol unlocks for them. This includes:

* Daily royalty payments
* Advances against future royalties
* Fan engagement opportunities
* Splitting their royalties among other parties of their choice

Artists are one of the core users of the OWN protocol and participate in the benefits of the growth of the network, which include greater utility for the $OWN token, future artist features and decreased fees for network use.

**Creating an OMA**: Artists elect to create an OMA and do this via one of the recognized protocol oracles, most likely the oracle who manages their existing royalty payment flow. Creating an OMA incurs a one time $OWN fee split between the validating oracle and the protocol reserve. The oracle validates the OMA and provides an asset fact sheet available for protocol participants to access. As part of creating an OMA, artists agree to certain data regarding their asset being publicly available information on the blockchain.

Artists choose which blockchain to create their OMA on from the ecosystem protocols that the OWN network works with (example: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon etc).

Upon creation of their OMA, artists decide on certain attributes of their asset:

* Payee wallets of the royalty stream: an OMA can divide the payment between different wallets&#x20;
* Currency of on chain payment (USDC, LUSD, ETH, OWN etc)
* Privacy settings

In the future greater privacy flexibility will be enabled by integration with Zero Knowledge solutions.

Once an artist has created an OMA, they have full control over the cash flow of their media asset. They can elect to split it with family, friends or fans, collateralize it, trade it over the counter or add it to a liquidity pool to get an advance on future royalties. Most of these actions require opening a wrapped OMA, a wrapper contract, that adds further data and provisions to their OMA. Some of these actions will also require them to get their OMA analyzed by Data Provider Nodes who can offer third parties appraisals and evaluations on the value of their OMA.

Artists can also elect to turn NFT revenue into OMAs and thus add further value to music or media NFTs they create. Eventually we foresee artists creating vaults built around the value their assets create, integrated with fan engagement so that fans can contribute, participate and share in the upside of the creators they love.
