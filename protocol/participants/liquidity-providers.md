# Liquidity Providers

Providing artists liquidity is a core reason for the OWN protocol. To provide initial liquidity, the OWN protocol is providing the design and implementation for the first liquidity pool. Music assets’ royalty streams may fluctuate due the underlying nature of the artists’ royalty payments. Diversification of wOMAs in the liquidity pool serves to provide a steady stream of cash flow.&#x20;

Once a wOMA is opened for an OMA it can be deposited into the liquidity pool. The protocol will set up three liquidity pools for three tiers of risk. Liquidity pool yield will adjust based on the risk weighting of the assets in the pool. wOMA holders will receive a liquidity pool advance based on the risk profile of their wOMA. Higher risk assets, categorized by higher variability in their will receive a higher discount rate, providing liquidity pool providers with an appropriate risk reward.&#x20;

Once a wOMA has been created, artists have the option to do anything they desire with it, either in private placements or other NFT marketplaces, providing OWN protocol liquidity pools grants immediate utility to creating a wOMA and OMA.

Anyone can provide liquidity and in the future we envision artist communities being built around fans providing liquidity for artists and creators they love.&#x20;
