# Oracles

Oracles are in charge of validating OMAs and distributing payments to artists’ blockchain assets. They bridge the off-chain and on-chain worlds. Oracles are participants in the music industry: music rights owners, distributors and publishers with access to the information and revenue flow needed to be the bridge between worlds.

To become an oracle, a party must be verified by the OWN Foundation and stake $OWN while they are oracles. Only verified oracles have an authentication signature recognized by the protocol. OMAs that are not validated and signed by recognized protocol oracles cannot use the wrapped OMA contract, and should not be trusted by the community as no music industry player has committed to transferring royalty payments on-chain.

Oracles primarily deal with the artists they manage and distribute payments to. They provide a UI for artists to opt into creating OMAs for their assets and onboard them into the web3 ecosystem as needed. Oracles check that the OMA has no legal red flags or copyright infringement claims and make the OMA fact sheet available for usage by 3rd party protocol participants, on and off chain.&#x20;

Oracles receive music streaming data and payments from DSPs and submit payments on chain. Oracles commit to sending payments on-chain within 30 days of receiving payments from DSPs to ensure fast and efficient payment bridging between the off chain and on chain world.

Oracles who are found to be fraudulent actors can expect to have their stake slashed, the exact amount dependent upon the type of network fault. An example of a network fault for which an oracle would be penalized is not transmitting funds on chain to a relevant OMA in a timely fashion, despite receiving the funds from DSPs or public rights management companies. You can read more about oracle [slashing here](broken-reference).

### How much are oracles required to stake?

Oracles come in all shapes and sizes and the OWN protocol works with large record labels as well as smaller independent ones. Thus the amount to be staked varies per label and is sized in proportion to their revenue (when they first join the protocol as oracles), and no less than 10,000 $OWN. Oracles can elect to stake larger amounts as well, to a maximum of 10% of the issued tokens.

Minimum and maximum staking amounts are set to avoid not having enough 'skin in the game' on the low end and too much value capture on the high end.

Oracles are vetted and approved by the OWN Foundation in a centralized fashion. Staking $OWN isn’t to protect the network against a 51% attack, rather it’s to provide collateral in case oracles become bad actors. Therefore we enact a slashing mechanism in needed cases.

#### Cool down period&#x20;

Oracles who wish to leave the protocol can unstake their $OWN six months after they stop being an oracle. The music industry has long payment periods, therefore a longer cool down period is needed so that fraud nodes can submit relevant fraud proofs if needed. During this period rewards continue to accrue and governance position is weighted as normal.
