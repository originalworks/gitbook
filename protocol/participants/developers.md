# Developers

OWN brings artists and developers together to create consumer and B2B applications. Developers are rewarded for their important role in the ecosystem and expanding the protocol. As part of our tokenomics, token grants are reserved for developer teams to build web3 experiences on the OWN protocol. &#x20;

The OWN protocol follows regenerative finance (ReFi) practices: a built-in fee infrastructure, generating revenue that returns to a pool to fund continued development.

Permissionless freedom is a core tenet of the OWN protocol. We believe that by enabling the core web3 primitives and building blocks for bringing media IP royalty streams on chain we will enable a flurry of innovation and building on top.&#x20;

OWN components are built to interact seamlessly with other web3 primitives such as DeFi, NFTs and artist tokens. While we offer designs and recommended implementation for various components such as wOMAs and Liquidity Pools, these components have no inherent lock in and developers can choose to interact with OMAs any way they want.
