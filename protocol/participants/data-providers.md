# Data Providers

Data Providers provide advanced analytics and financial analysis on OMAs. Artist royalty streams are not a traditional cash flow and therefore not all third parties will know how to evaluate and forecast future flows. Additionally, some artists will prefer that some of their data will remain anonymized or not readily public available and thus third party data providers are needed to offer these services.

DPs are ecosystem players in the OWN protocol who have the ability to provide these services and make their data available on chain for any third party to use. Example DPs could be:&#x20;

* Digital Streaming Providers (DSP)&#x20;
* Record Labels&#x20;
* Distributors
* Copyright Societies
* Performing Rights Organizations
* Collective Management Organizations
* Participating financial Institutions & Lenders
* DeFi Protocols
