# Fraud Governance

Fraud governance enables aggrieved players to submit a claim of wrongdoing by a network participant, such as an oracle. Claims usually regard the flow of payments on-chain or lack thereof. Once on-chain evidence of a network fault has been accumulated, a fraud agent can submit the fraud proof to protocol governance for adjudication. Adjudication occurs by a governing body determined by the protocol governance.

Should the proof prove successful, the oracle is penalized, and its stake is slashed (in accordance with the kind of wrongdoing). The slashed stake is split between the fraud agent and the injured party. Examples of protocol fraud can be:

* Not transmitting funds on chain to a relevant OMA in a timely fashion, despite receiving the funds from DSPs&#x20;
* Providing an asset fact sheet that is incorrect, or not readily available.

Fraud agents can be oracles or other parties able to parse on-chain data to collect the evidence needed to submit a network fault to prove a case for fraudulent behavior. Fraud agents are rewarded for valid fraud proofs and penalized lightly for rejected fraud proofs.
