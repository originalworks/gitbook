# Rights Management

With Original Works, **Rights Holders** can interact directly with the splits contract and royalty pool and do not require administrative control for managing their rights, and verifying or claiming their royalty payments

The protocol enables rights holders the following actions using the open source Registry, wallet application and subgraph endpoints available for application builders:

* View their registered assets
* Monitor royalty generation
* Transfer rights (depending on the permission settings by the Royalty Admin)
* Update split information
* Delegate collection rights
* Maintain historical records
* Provide proofs without exposing data
