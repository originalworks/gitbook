# Royalty Claims Process

**Royalty Claims** can be performed by any rights holder using a wallet or web interface, or by any smart contract holding Royalty Vouchers (like royalty advance pools).&#x20;

Claiming is done directly from the pool following the steps below:

* View earnings statements
* Generate proofs of ownership
* Claim multiple assets at once (to save transaction fees and obfuscate earnings)
* Use new addresses for each claim (to enhance privacy)
* Receive payments in stablecoins
  * Once an asset has been paid, all rights holders across the globe may instantly claim their share of the royalty payment.
* Verify payment accuracy
  * Their payout will always be equal to their split of the incoming payment (excluding withholding or recoupment that must also be accounted for in the payout receipt).&#x20;
