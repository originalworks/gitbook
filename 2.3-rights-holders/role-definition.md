### Rights Holders on the Original Works protocol

Rights holders are the creators, performers, labels, and publishers who own rights in music assets, or any party who purchased those rights. In the Original Works protocol, they maintain ownership of their rights while gaining new tools for rights management and royalty collection. \
\
Rights Holder do not need any direct integration with the protocol as they interact with the protocol through their chosen Royalty Admins while maintaining privacy and control over their earnings.

Ideally, rights holders don't need to know about the Original Works protocol as an underlying royalty settlement layer, and the protocol's developer tools and application interfaces enable Royalty Admins to provide simple and direct access to rights data and royalty payments through their own user interface.&#x20;
