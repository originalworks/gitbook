## Protocol Overview


The digital transformation of the music industry has created an unprecedented opportunity. Music consumption has shifted almost entirely to streaming platforms, generating digital-native cashflows that should be ideal for automated processing and distribution. However, these streams of revenue remain trapped in opaque, siloed systems that rely on outdated reconciliation methods and manual synchronization processes. By bringing royalty and IP data on-chain, Original Works creates a foundation for a new economic layer built on top of music rightsâ€”an uncorrelated asset class that generates billions of dollars annually in global revenue.

With decades of experience in the music industry, we understand that most artists prefer to focus on their creative work rather than becoming entrepreneurs. They rely on service providers to handle the complex business aspects of their careers. Original Works acknowledges this reality by enabling existing music distributors and publishers to serve as network oracles. These service providers can participate in the protocol by running our client software and staking tokens, while maintaining their current business operations and relationships with artists. This approach preserves the valuable role of industry professionals while introducing greater efficiency and transparency to their services.
