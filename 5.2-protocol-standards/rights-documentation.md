### Rights Documentation

The protocol implements privacy-first rights documentation:

- **Split Information**:
  - Stored locally in Royalty Pool Merkle trees
  - Visible only to rightful participants
  - Rightsholder sees only their own share
  - Admin maintains complete split table

- **Rights Coverage**:
  - Royalty Admins document rights types (performance, mechanical, sync)
  - Territory specifications supported
  - Percentage control recorded
  - Term/duration tracking available

- **Privacy Options**:
  - Complete privacy mode available
  - Selective disclosure controls
  - Rights verification without exposure
  - Configurable transparency levels

- **Rights Conflicts**:
  - Staking creates economic disincentive for false claims
  - Automated conflict detection
  - Resolution process support
  - Verifiable proof of administration

This system balances transparency with confidentiality, giving rights holders and admins control over sensitive business information.
