# Benefits of Original Works

The Original Works Network is designed to incentivize various participants to actively contribute to its ecosystem. Each stakeholder benefits from unique advantages that foster collaboration, innovation, and sustainable growth within the music rights management and royalty distribution landscape.\

**For Artists & Creators:**\


* Faster Payments: Artists receive their royalties significantly faster than traditional systems. With USDC settlements processed in minutes, artists gain near-instant access to their earnings.
