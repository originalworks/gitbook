### ISCC Generation

The International Standard Content Code (ISCC) provides content-based identification through perceptual fingerprinting. Unlike ISRCs and ISWCs which must be assigned by authorized entities, ISCCs can be generated algorithmically from the content itself.

**Original Works implements ISCC generation:**
- Directly from audio files
- Independent of formal registration
- As early proof of creation
- For content matching and verification

**The ISCC generation process:**
1. Processes audio to extract perceptual features
2. Generates content fingerprint
3. Combines with minimal metadata
4. Creates a unique, collision-resistant identifier

**This enables several key features:**
- Identification of unlabeled content
- Verification of authenticity
- Proof of creation timestamp
- Content similarity matching

Creators can generate ISCCs before formal distribution, establishing verifiable timestamp proof of their work that persists through the distribution process.
