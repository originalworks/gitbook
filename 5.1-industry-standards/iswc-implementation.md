### ISWC Implementation

The International Standard Musical Work Code (ISWC) identifies unique musical compositions and is managed by Royalty Admins focused on publishing rights, such as music publishers and CMOs.

**Original Works provides:**
- Registration of ISWCs through CWR messages
- Linking compositions to associated recordings
- Mapping ISWC-to-ISRC relationships
- Tracking territorial rights variations

**Publishers register ISWCs through the protocol by:**
- Submitting standardized CWR files
- Providing complete work information
- Registering writer shares
- Documenting territorial rights

The protocol enhances ISWC implementation by creating a verifiable rights registry while maintaining compatibility with existing collection societies and publishing systems.
