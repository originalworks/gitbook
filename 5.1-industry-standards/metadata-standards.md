### Metadata Standards

Original Works supports comprehensive metadata standards while providing flexibility for different industry participants.

The protocol standardizes on:
- DDEX data dictionary values
- CWR field specifications
- MusicBrainz compatible identifiers
- ISO territory codes

Metadata implementation includes:
- Required core fields for registration
- Optional extended metadata
- Controlled vocabulary enforcement
- Versioning support

Royalty Admins can determine:
- Which optional fields to include
- Level of public metadata disclosure
- Granularity of rights information
- Additional proprietary metadata

The protocol maintains compatibility with industry standards while enhancing them with:
- Immutable record keeping
- Verifiable updates
- Standardized access controls
- Cross-format integration

This approach ensures that all required information for rights management is available while allowing Royalty Admins to maintain their preferred level of metadata disclosure.
