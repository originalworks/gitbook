### ISRC Integration

The International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) serves as the primary identifier for sound recordings within the Original Works protocol. These 12-character codes uniquely identify each recording and are essential for tracking usage and royalties.

**Royalty Admins managing sound recordings (distributors and labels) issue and register ISRCs through the protocol by:**
- Submitting DDEX.ERN messages containing ISRCs
- Verifying uniqueness within their catalog
- Linking recordings to appropriate metadata
- Ensuring compliance with ISRC standards

**The protocol enhances ISRC functionality by:**
- Creating verifiable on-chain records
- Linking ISRCs to tokenized rights
- Enabling automated royalty tracking
- Maintaining complete registration history

Each registered ISRC becomes part of the decentralized registry, ensuring consistent identification across platforms while maintaining compatibility with traditional industry systems.# ISRC Integration
