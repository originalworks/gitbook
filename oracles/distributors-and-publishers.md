### Royalty Administrators

Royalty Administrators play a critical role in the Original Works ecosystem, as they are the gateway to the off-chain music industry. There are two main types of royalty administratos (which may further outsource the work to different veriaties of admins and service providers), namely **Music Distributors** responsible with the distribution and monetization of the "Master" rights (sometimes also refered to as Phonograph os the Sound Recording) and **Music Publishers** who are in charge with registering the "Musical Work" (composition and lyrics) - Sometimes the rights holders of the Master and Work overlap, but many time they are different and mostly involve multiple rights holders (royalty splits), who are also represented by different Royalty Administrators in different jusridictions - this greatly contributes to the fragmentation of the industry and adds to the friction in last-mile settlements of royalies. Both of these "Oracle" types are exclusively applicable to legal entities, which are contractually obligated to collect and pay royalties to rights holders and often also get paid by taking a fee from the collected royalties., though different commercial terms may apply. At the first phase of the protocol, Royalty Administrators will require authentication and this will be permissioned service. Once the tokenomics are introduces and staking will be required, the protocol will transition to being fully permissionless.
