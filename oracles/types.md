# Types of Royalty Admins

The protocol recognizes two primary types of Royalty Admins, reflecting the established structure of the music industry's supply chain.

### Essential Royalty Admins

Critical for the decentralized release authentication. These music supply-chain service providers include:

* Distributors
* Publishers

### Non-Essential Royalty Admins

Once the digital release notification is signed by an Essential Royalty Admin, they usually provide all the data, revenue reporting and on-chain payments, but these may be outsourced to non-essential Royalty Admins; such as:

* Verified Data Providers
* CMOs (Collective Management Organizations)
* Royalty and Service Administrators
* Payment Providers
