- Tokenize master recording rights using protocol standards
- Operate Royalty Pools for master recording earnings

- Enable automated royalty splits through smart contracts

## Publishers

Traditional Industry Role:

## Combined Service Providers

Although in most cases a an oracle will be distributing OR publishing music, some organizations provide both distribution and publishing services. In these cases, they can:
- Operate as both types of Oracles

- Process both DDEX.ERN and CWR through a single OWEN installation
- Provide comprehensive rights management on the protocol
