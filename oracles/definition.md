# Definition and Requirements

In the Original Works protocol, Oracles serve as bridges between off-chain music industry data and the blockchain network. While initially these entities will be established music service providers who already manage rights administration and royalty collection, the protocol is designed to evolve into a completely permissionless public good. Once the token economy stabilizes, staking $OWN will become the sole requirement for Oracle status, ensuring the protocol remains truly decentralized and accessible to all qualified participants.

#### In the current phase of the protocol roadmap, to qualify as an Oracle, an entity must:

* Be a legally registered business entity in their jurisdiction (This requirement will remain in affect only during the first phase of the protocol, before being completely replaced by staking, transforming OW to a permissionless protocol)
* Have existing contractual relationships with rights holders
* Demonstrate technical capability to run the OWEN client
* Generate standard industry formats (DDEX.ERN, CWR)

#### In the next phase of the protocol roadmap, once staking is enabled, Oracles will also have staking requirements:

* Stake a minimum amount of protocol tokens ($OWN) to participate, earn rewards, and receive discounts on protocol fees.
* Oracles also commit to maintaining accurate and timely royalty accounting records and poor maintenance of records may result in a slash of their staked $OWN.&#x20;
