# Definition and Requirements

In the Original Works protocol, Royalty Admins serve as bridges between off-chain music industry data and the blockchain network. While initially these entities will be established music service providers who already manage rights administration and royalty collection, the protocol is designed to evolve into a completely permissionless public good. Once the token economy stabilizes, staking $OWN will become the sole requirement for Royalty Admin status, ensuring the protocol remains truly decentralized and accessible to all qualified participants.

### In the current phase of our roadmap, to qualify as a Royalty Admin, an entity must:

* Be a legally registered business entity in their jurisdiction.
  * This requirement will be in effect only during the phase 1 of the protocol roadmap, before being replaced by staking â€” transforming Original Works to a permissionless protocol.
* Have existing contractual relationships with rights holders.
* Demonstrate technical capability to run the OWEN client.
* Generate standard industry formats (DDEX.ERN, CWR).

### In the next phase of the protocol roadmap once staking is enabled, Royalty Admins will also have staking requirements:

* Stake a minimum amount of protocol tokens ($OWN) to participate, earn rewards, and receive discounts on protocol fees.
* Royalty Admins also commit to maintaining accurate and timely royalty accounting records and poor maintenance of records may result in a slash of their staked $OWN.
