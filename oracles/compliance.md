# Compliance Requirements

The protocol enhances existing compliance capabilities:

Regulatory Alignment:

* Automated audit trails
* Enhanced transparency
* Simplified reporting
* Privacy-preserving verification

Data Management:

* Secure storage of sensitive information - Merkle trees are hosted on local or enterprise grade cloud solutions and are not expected to be hosted on-chain.
* Controlled access to rights data - Rights Holders can publicly prove ownership without exposing share-percentages or revenue data, and each individual rights holder receives cryptographically-verified royalty splits, without being exposed to other shareholder splits.
* Enhanced, standardized record keeping - IPFS provides a distributed and robust "audit trail" for metadata; Merkle trees maintain a full auditable trace of royalty splits and are tamper-evident with respect to rights holders issued rights.&#x20;
* Royalties are deposited into the Royalty Pool remain under the control of the Royalty Admin, and the Royalty Admin controls the requirements claims can be processed&#x20;
* Coupled with the $OWN staking and slashing mechanism the protocol enforces transparent data, rights and royalty management.
