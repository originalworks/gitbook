### Compliance Requirements

The protocol enhances existing compliance capabilities:

Regulatory Alignment:
- Automated audit trails
- Enhanced transparency
- Simplified reporting
- Privacy-preserving verification

Data Management:
- Secure storage of sensitive information - Merkle trees are hosted on local or enterprise grade cloud solutions and are not expected to be hosted on-chain.
- Controlled access to rights data - Rights Holders can publically prove ownership without exposing sharepercentages or revenue data, and each individual rights holder receives cryptographically-verified royalty splits, without being exposed other shareholder splits.
- Enganced, standardized record keeping - IPFS provides a distributed and robust "audit trail" for metadata and Merkle trees maintain a full auditable trace of royalty splis and are tamper-evident with respect to rightsholders issued rights; Coupled with the $OWN staking and slashing mechanism the protocol enforces transparent royalty management.
