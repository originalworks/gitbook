# Staking Mechanism

The Original Works protocol implements staking system that secures network operations while aligning incentives between participants:

## Royalty Admin Staking

* **Base Stake Requirement**:
  * Minimum stake varies by role and responsibilities
  * Distributors/publishers require base stake proportional to catalog size
  * Stake locked during active participation
* **Tiered Responsibilities**:
  * Asset Registration: Base stake requirement
  * Rights Management: Additional stake proportional to rights managed
  * Royalty Pool Operation: Highest stake requirement scaling with pool volume
* **Dynamic Adjustment**:
  * Stake requirements proportional to:
    * Transaction volume
    * Assets under management
    * Pool liquidity
    * Rights complexity
* **Slashing Conditions**:
  * Provably false submissions
  * Conflicting registrations
  * Regulatory non-compliance
  * Sustained operational failures

## Validator Staking

* **Network Security**:
  * Minimum validator stake requirement for network participation
  * Stake locked during active validation
  * Earning potential proportional to stake amount
  * Delegation options for capital efficiency
* **Commitment Periods**:
  * Variable lock-up durations
  * Longer commitments earn higher rewards
  * Unbonding period for network security
  * Early exit penalties
* **Validator Selection**:
  * Stake-weighted validation authority
  * Performance metrics influence selection
  * Reputation scoring affects rewards
  * Active/standby rotation system

## Community Staking

* **Royalty Advance Pools**&#x20;
