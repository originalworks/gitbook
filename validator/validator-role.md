### Network Role and Importance

Validators are crucial participants in the Original Works protocol, serving as the decentralized verification layer that ensures the integrity and authenticity of music industry data. They perform three essential functions:
1. Verify the accuracy and completeness of Royalty Admin submissions
2. Generate and validate zero-knowledge proofs of data integrity
3. Maintain an indexed registry of verified music assets

By operating independently from Royalty Admins, validators create a trustless system where no single entity controls the flow of information. This separation of duties ensures that the protocol remains resistant to manipulation while maintaining the privacy of sensitive business data.
